# little-squirrel-and-little-rabbit
 This time my project was to create an electronic storybook for children between the ages of 4 and 8, and the theme was the friendship between the squirrel and the rabbit. Through the adventures of two cute animals, children can learn the Chinese medicine of good friendship and realize the importance of cooperation. This book was inspired by the fact that some children often experience a little social fear in their daily lives, especially when they are involved in groups and interacting with other children. Because most of the children's education books on the market today are biased towards fantasy, but I think friendship is also an important theme. Therefore, I hope that this story book will provide an excellent educational way for children to understand the core value of friendship. Compared with traditional paper-based reading, digital reading has its unique advantages of being able to combine video, sound and text (Qiao, 2023). Therefore, I chose the e-book format, aiming to provide a more in-depth learning experience for children.
